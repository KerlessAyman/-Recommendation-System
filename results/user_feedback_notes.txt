User Feedback on Recommendations:

- The recommended articles are mostly relevant and aligned with my interests.
- Some articles are too similar in content, especially those from the same category.
- I would prefer to see more diversity in topics and categories.
- The recommendations seem a bit outdated; including more recent news would improve the system.
- Overall, the recommendation quality is acceptable, but there is room for improvement in personalization and freshness.
